        <h1>Advanced Infantry Training</h1>
        <p>Welcome to the advanced guide for infantry operations. This manual covers formations, drills, and tactical movement techniques essential for complex combat scenarios.</p>
        <p>This section will give further information on formations, immediate action drills,
            and buddy team bounding overwatch. Note that this training is more practical
            and requires multiple people to complete.
            </p>

        <!-- Section: Formations and Sectors -->
        <section class="manual-section" id="formations">
            <h2>Formations and Sectors</h2>
            <div class="content1" id="formations-content">
                <p>During advanced infantry you will start off by practicing movement in a
                    formation. If you need a refresher on the different formations, see Basic
                    Infantry.
                    Also pay attention to the Shacktac HUD, a very useful add on that allows you to
                    see where your team members are, their names and also where north, east,
                    south and west is.</p>
            
                <p>The inner circle is 10 meters, the next one 25 and the last one 50. Remember to
                    try and keep the spacing between you and your team mates at 5 meters to
                    prevent multiple casualties due to explosives.</p>

            <div class="content1" id="immediate-action-content">
                <h3>Contact Drill (Immediate Assault Drill)</h3>
                <p>When to use the contact drill: Enemies are nearby and pose an immediate threat to you or 
                    friendlies. This drill is also used when your team comes under fire.</p>
                <p>How to do the contact drill<br>
                    When you spot the immediate threat you start with the key word: 'Contact'
                    followed by a direction: 'front, left, right, etc.â€™ The team will then face in that
                    direction and start suppressing that area, whether they can see a target or not.
                    If possible the person who called the contact will provide the team lead with
                    more information. Once the threat is dealt with, all team members should cover
                    their sectors again.
                </p>
                <h3>Freeze Drill (Immediate Halt Drill)</h3>
                <p> When to use the freeze drill<br>
                    You have spotted a (possible) threat that does not pose an immediate threat to
                    you or friendlies and requires further investigation. 
                </p>
                <p> How to do the freeze drill <br>
                    When you spot the threat, call out 'Freeze' followed by the type of the threat,
                    the direction and the range. The entire team will hold and face their sectors.
                    Except for the team leader who will then try to find the threat and determine
                    what to do from there.

        <!-- Section: Bounding Overwatch -->

            <h2>Bounding Overwatch</h2>
            <div class="content1" id="bounding-overwatch-content">
                <p>Bounding overwatch is a movement technique that allows a team to move
                    through enemy fire while continuously suppressing enemies. It can be used to
                    both advance towards an enemy position and to fall back. It can also be used to
                    cross open areas that are potentially dangerous.
                </p>
                <p>Bounding is done in buddy teams (Red, Blue and Gold; see Basic Infantry for
                    more info about the buddy teams). If a full Special Forces team is using
                    bounding overwatch, red and blue will by default be grouped together for the
                    duration of the maneuver and be called red. 
                </p>
                <p>Bounding overwatch is called in the following manner. The team lead will
                    announce 'Bounding overwatch', 'Destination or direction' 'Team that
                    moves first'. For example: 'Bounding Overwatch, to the large hangar to the
                    north, Gold move'.
                </p>
                <p>The first team (here Gold) will then move up 15 meters and hold (if possible in
                    cover), start suppressing the enemy and call over direct chat 'Set' the other
                    ream (Red) will then move up and pass the first team, they will then hold 15
                    meters past the first team, start suppressing and announce 'Set'. Gold team will
                    then move again, etc. until the target is reached. The team lead will then
                    announce 'Regroup' to end the Bounding Overwatch. 
                </p>
                <p>Note that it is important to not move further than 15 metres past the buddy
                    team thatâ€™s covering you. If you take too long they might run out of ammo.
                </p>
