                <p>Fireteam leading is a difficult training to tackle. It requires concentration,
                    situational awareness, confidence and a solid understanding of our tactics and
                    training. Most of all, however, it requires practical experience. This document will
                    lay out all the theoretical and practical information we have gathered from
                    multiple sources over the course of years of fireteam leading in Arma 2 and 3. It
                    is a great starting point for any aspiring leader, but it does require you to get out
                    there and lead a fireteam yourself. You will make mistakes, but as long as you
                    learn from them, you will get better.</p>

            <h2 onclick="toggleSection('role-content')" class="collapsible">The Role of a Fireteam Lead</h2>
            <div class="content" id="role-content">
                <p>
                    <strong>Setting the Tone:</strong> <br> 
                    Before we get into the nitty gritty of being an FTL, we have to talk about setting
                    “the tone”. This can be defined as the general mood or atmosphere within the
                    session. For our tactics to work and for you to be an effective fireteam lead, the
                    tone has to be serious. We sometimes refer to it as “game faces”. Everyone
                    stops joking around and focuses on playing the game. As the leader of your
                    group, you are responsible for setting and maintaining the tone. If one of your
                    team members starts cracking jokes when it‟s inappropriate (e.g. you are about
                    to make contact with the enemy), you have to call them on it and get them to
                    focus. If you can‟t get them to shut up and take the game seriously, report it to
                    the admins. We don‟t tolerate players who don‟t respect their team lead.</p>
                <p><strong>Enforcing Tactics:</strong> <br>
                    Your team mates will often forget or choose not to properly execute a certain
                    tactic or procedure, which can put their or others‟ lives at risk. As a fireteam
                    lead, it is your job make sure they adhere to our standard of play. Make sure you
                    are fully up to date on all relevant trainings, because you are the role model for
                    the average player.</p>
                <p><strong>Autonomy:</strong> <br>
                    Styles of squad leading vary from person to person, but as a fireteam lead you
                    can expect a certain level of autonomy. Don‟t expect your squad leader to
                    micromanage you. He will tell you to clear a building or move to a certain
                    position and it‟s up to you to figure out the best way to do it. This doesn‟t take
                    away the fact that you can still call up your squad leader if you don‟t know how
                    to best carry out their orders.</p>
                <p><strong>Keep it Fun:</strong> <br> 
                    At the end of the day we‟re all still playing a game. It‟s important that you keep
                    everyone focused and playing the game up to our standards, but it‟s equally
                    important that it‟s a fun experience for everyone. On one hand this means
                    playing a style of Arma that is more than just sitting on a hilltop plinking away at
                    enemies. We don‟t just use fire and manoeuvre tactics because they‟re effective,
                    but also because they‟re fun. Be dynamic, not static. On the other hand you
                    should balance out the aforementioned seriousness with some levity. Set the
                    example of when banter is appropriate. Tell jokes during a long car ride, or when
                    we‟re waiting on something or someone. You might make some friends along the
                    way.</p>

        <section class="manual-section" id="equipment">
            <h2 onclick="toggleSection('equipment-content')" class="collapsible">Equipment</h2>
            <div class="content" id="equipment-content">
                <p>This section will describe the equipment you will have at your disposal as a
                    fireteam lead and how to use it to its maximum effect.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Binoculars</strong> <br> 
                        Every fireteam has two sets of binoculars. The fireteam lead and the assistant
                        automatic rifleman each have one. It is important to use them sparingly. You
                        don‟t want to spend an entire firefight with your binoculars out when you could
                        be laying down fire instead. Remember that you are one of four rifles in your
                        team. If you‟re within 300 metres, you should be firing instead of watching.</li>
                    <li><strong>Smoke Grenades</strong> <br> 
                        Smoke grenades are an extremely useful tool when used right. You have eight
                        smoke grenades spread out over your fireteam. Make sure to use them.
                        Their main purpose is to break line of sight between you and your enemy. This
                        causes the enemy‟s fire to become less accurate or even stop, which allows you
                        to make an aggressive move, or fall back.
                        Smoke positioning is very important. The closer the smoke grenade lands to the
                        enemy, the more it will obscure their view, but the easier it will be for them to
                        reposition to see past the smoke. This principle also applies to your team, so it is
                        generally ill-advised to throw a smoke grenade right on top of yourself. Throw it
                        in the enemies‟ direction instead.
                        Wind direction and strength will heavily influence how useful your smoke is.
                        Stronger winds will mean a longer, lower smoke screen. Always take note of the
                        wind direction to position your smokes appropriately.
                        If you ever need an emergency smoke screen, call out: “TEAM NAME, pop smoke
                        to the DIRECTION OF ENEMY FIRE”.</li>
                    <li><strong>Grenade Launcher</strong> <br> 
                        The under barrel grenade launcher can be a very useful weapon when used
                        appropriately. You have two types of grenades to fire.5
                        First, you have HE (high explosive) grenades. These are useful for indirect fire to
                        hit targets you can‟t see, killing groups of enemies, destroying or damaging
                        vehicles, etc. Because of their destructive nature, you have to be very careful
                        when using them. Make sure there are no friendly or civilian units close to your
                        target.
                        Second, you have smoke grenades (white, red, green). These can be useful to to
                        create smoke cover at long range and mark enemy (red) or friendly (green)
                        positions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Anti-Tank Weapons</strong> <br>
                        Every fireteam has an unguided anti-tank launcher with one rocket. Its effective
                        range is about 300-400 metres depending on the launcher itself. Its primary use
                        is to destroy vehicles (particularly armoured vehicles), but it can also be used to
                        destroy buildings or blow holes in walls (breaching) to create alternative entry
                        points.
                        If you hear or see a vehicle approaching that‟s worthy of being blown up with
                        your AT launcher, call out: “Ready AT”. Don‟t leave your rifleman in this state too
                        long, though. He won‟t be able to fire his rifle and you risk him blowing up your
                        entire team if he‟s not careful. Always make sure the appropriate backblast
                        procedure is used to prevent accidental injuries.</li>
                    <li><strong>Light machine guns and guiding fire</strong><br>
                        The automatic rifleman (AR) is probably the most important member of your
                        team besides yourself. He puts down a large volume of fire and can do so at up
                        to 600 metres. It is very important to always put your AR in the best position to
                        engage enemies in order to get maximum value out of his machine gun.
                        At longer ranges, it is important to guide the fire of your machine gunner. This is
                        where your binoculars become very useful, because you yourself cannot
                        effectively engage enemies beyond 300 metres. Watch for the tracers and the
                        impacts of your AR‟s fire and correct appropriately using UP, DOWN, LEFT, or
                        RIGHT followed by the number of metres that your AR should adjust for in order
                        to hit the target. For example, if your machine gunner‟s fire is landing five
                        metres below and two metres left of the target, you would say: “up five, right
                        two”.</li>
                </ul>

        <!-- Section: Communication -->
        <section class="manual-section" id="communication">
            <h2 onclick="toggleSection('communication-content')" class="collapsible">Communication</h2>
            <div class="content" id="communication-content">
                <p>Communication within a squad is very important. It provides situational
                    awareness for everyone involved which leads to better decision making. Know
                    where all friendly elements are and what they are doing. You‟re not just limited
                    to communication with your squad leader. You can and should coordinate with
                    other fireteams when necessary.
                    Furthermore, the fireteam lead is the relay between your team members and
                    other leaders. Other members of the fireteam have no business on the radio,
                    unless you are dead. The communication from a fireteam should come from one
                    source only.
                    Finally, always keep your squad lead up to date on what you‟re doing. This
                    doesn‟t mean you should be radioing in every five seconds, but if you‟re starting
                    an attack or you have completed an order, let squad lead know.</p>

        <!-- Section: Infantry Tactics -->
        <section class="manual-section" id="infantry-tactics">
            <h2 onclick="toggleSection('infantry-tactics-content')" class="collapsible">Infantry Tactics</h2>
            <div class="content" id="infantry-tactics-content">
                <p>This is the most important section of this training document. You will spend most
                    of your team on foot as a fireteam leader and as such you need to be able to
                    apply all concepts mentioned below. They will keep your team alive.</p>
                <h3>General Orders</h3>
                <p>There are the orders you will be using pretty much every couple of minutes<br>
                <h4>360 coverage</h4>
                <p>“Watch your sectors” or “360” are the most common call-outs. The goal here is
                to have every team member cover a 90° angle so that you are never caught out
                by flanking enemies. Your team will forget and want to look forwards where the
                enemies are. If you don‟t need them to shoot, make them watch their sectors.
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>The general set-up (as mentioned in basic infantry) is</strong></li>
                    <li>Fireteam lead - front</li>
                    <li>Automatic rifleman - right</li>
                    <li>Assistant automatic rifleman - left</li>
                    <li>Rifleman (AT) - rear    </li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can modify this setup depending on where hostiles are most likely to come
                    from. For example, if you expect enemies from the left, you can put the AR there
                    instead.
                </p>
                <h4>Move/hold</h4>
                <p>
                    “Moving” or “Moving out”, and “Hold”, “Holding” are the most common call-outs.
                    Because your team mates are diligently watching their sectors, they can‟t always
                    tell when the team starts or stops moving. Therefore, you should always let your
                    team know when you‟re holding or moving.
                </p>
                <h4>Cover</h4>
                <p>
                    “Grab cover”, “Grab a tree”, “Get in cover”, etc. are the most used call-outs.
                    You‟d be surprised how often people don‟t get in cover because they want to get
                    kills. Staying alive is usually more important than getting cover (with the
                    exception of the contact drill). Watch your team members and call them out
                    individually if you have to. You can save many lives if you consistently make
                    your team members seek cover.
                </p>
                <h4>Spacing</h4>
                <p>
                    “Watch your spacing”, “Spread out”, etc. are the most used call-outs.
                    Again, this is easily forgotten by people, but it is very important. You avoid
                    getting everyone killed by a grenade, but you also avoid everyone getting
                    mowed down with one machine gun burst. Appropriate spread is 5-10 metres
                    between each team member.
                </p>
                <h4>Weapons up/down</h4>
                <p>
                    “Weapons up” and “weapons down” are the appropriate call-outs.
                    Weapons down is used in situations where you don‟t expect contact, because it
                    consumes less stamina.
                    Weapons up is used when contact is likely.
                </p>
                <h3>Formations</h3>
                <p>
                    These have been discussed in basic infantry, but we‟ll discuss them from a
                    fireteam lead‟s point of view here.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The <strong>column</strong> is the most used formation, because it is dead simple to use.
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Purpose</strong></li>
                        <li>Travel in safe areas</li>
                        <li>Travel in difficult terrain</li>
                        <li>Appropriate speeds: walking - combat pace – jogging - sprinting</li>
                    </ul> 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The <strong>wedge</strong> is very useful, because it provides good firing lines in all directions,
                    but it is difficult to maneuver with.
                    <ul>

                        <li>When expecting contact, assaulting a position</li>

                    The <strong>line</strong> is a very specific formation that should only be used in specific
                    situations. It has great firing capabilities towards the front, but poor 360
                    coverage.

                        <li><strong>Purpose</strong></li>
                        <li>Assaulting a hilltop</li>

                <p>
                    Forests are an exception. You can and should still order formations within
                    forests, but it is far more important that your team members move from tree to
                    tree. This will make them harder to hit and spot. An exception to this exception
                    is if you have to move quickly through the forest.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While holding, you should apply the general principle that cover is more
                    important than a perfect formation. If a team member can move five to 10
                    metres in order to get behind a rock or a tree, make them
                </p>
                <h3>Buddy Teams</h3>
                <p>
                    As explained in basic infantry, the fireteam is further divided into two buddy
                    teams: Red (FTL + Rifleman) and Blue (AR + AAR). The reasoning behind this is
                    that you put the most and least experienced team member together and the AR
                    with the AAR. Always appoint a buddy team leader. He‟ll be in charge of
                    executing your orders and communicating with you. You want one clear voice to
                    communicate with, rather than two disjointed ones.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Buddy teams are extremely useful for splitting up the team. You can quickly clear
                    two houses by splitting up, or have the two teams cover separate corners in a
                    MOUT situation. They really come into play when you start using bounding
                    overwatch.
                </p>
                <h3>Bounding</h3>
                <p>
                    As explained in advanced infantry, bounding overwatch is a fire and manoeuvre
                    tactic in order to move while under fire. It can be used within a team (buddy
                    team bounding) or between teams (fireteam bounding). This section will discuss
                    buddy team bounding.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Bounding overwatch, blue move north” or “Blue, bound north” are the most
                    common call-outs. When bounding with suppressive fire, make sure to keep your
                    bounds short (30 metres at most). Bounds that take too long will no longer be
                    covered by suppressive fire. You‟ve got 30 seconds at most, considering a rate of
                    fire of 1 round per second and a 30 round magazine. If your second buddy teams
                    makes bounds that are too long, call them out on it the next time you bound
                    past them. Avoid using the radio for “moving” and “set” calls, because an entire
                    squad relies on the same short range radio channel. To end bounding overwatch,
                    call out for your team to “regroup on me”.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When bounding without suppressive fire, the maximum distance increases (~50-
                    75 metres), because you‟re not bound by the 30-second rule. 
                </p>
                <h3>Squad Formations</h3>
                <p>
                    Fireteam bounding works mostly the same as buddy team bounding. The main
                    differences are as follows. Bounding occurs between fireteams, rather than
                    between buddy teams and bounding distances are increased from 25-30 metres,
                    to 50-60 metres (up to 100 metres if not under fire). In order to achieve this
                    increased distance, firing rate should be lowered and it becomes more important
                    to find cover in the environment. This is compensated by having double the
                    amount of rifles you‟d have in buddy team bounding. ”Set” and “moving” calls
                    should be done over the short range radio. Finally, if the squad leader decides to
                    bound all 3 fireteams together, two of the fireteams will be grouped together
                    (typically 1 and 2).
                </p>
                <p>
                    The primary advantage of fireteam bounding is the increased distance between
                    bounds. This means less team is wasted stopping and starting movement, which
                    means faster movement overall. If large distances need to be crossed with
                    bounding, fireteam bounding becomes more attractive. Other advantages are the
                    ability to provide 360° coverage while bounding, and having more opportunities
                    to take cover. Downsides are the need of a radio, and fireteam members
                    sometimes needing to reload due to not lowering their rate of fire.
                    Fireteam bounding is called out in the following way: <strong>“*TEAMS TO BOUND*</strong>,
                    fireteam bounding to <strong>*DESTINATION/DIRECTION*, *TEAM X*</strong> move.”
                    Example: “Alpha 1, 2, fireteam bounding to the northeast, 1 move”.
                    If all three teams are involved, the call for which team to move first will make
                    clear which teams will be grouped together. Example: “Alpha 1, 2, and 3,
                    fireteam bounding to the northeast, 1 move”. This means Alpha 2 and 3 are
                    grouped together.
                </p>
                <h3>Squad formations</h3>
                <p>
                    Much like fireteams, squads can be formed up in multiple formations. We use the
                    same three formations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The <strong>column</strong> is the most used squad formation, because it is very easy to use.
                    It‟s generally used to travel long distances. In a full squad, the default order of
                    movement in a column is 1 - 2 - Lead - 3. This keeps the lead element
                    sufficiently in the back, while still its rear sector is still covered by a third
                    fireteam.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The <strong>wedge</strong> is primarily useful when the squad expects contact soon. The three
                    fireteams form a wedge as expected, but the lead element will be in the middle
                    of the wedge, rather than on the flanks.
                </P>
                <p>
                    The <strong>line</strong> can be used to initiate contact when enemies are unaware, or in order
                    to clear large hilltops. The three fireteams again form a line as expected, but the
                    lead element will be behind the line.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sector coverage has an extra added layer in squad formations. Each fireteam
                    should focus extra on the same sector that a team member would focus on in the
                    same fireteam formation. For example in a squad column, fireteam 2 would focus
                    extra on the right flank. This manifests itself with the fireteam leader focusing his
                    attention more on that sector.
                </p>
                <h3>Hilltop Clearing</h3>
                <p>
                    Clearing hilltops can very dangerous. The combination of short sightlines and
                    lack of cover can prove deadly. In order to minimize the risk, the line formation
                    is used. This forces the fireteam to move slowly, and causes all fireteam
                    members to crest the hilltop at the same time. Make sure the fireteam members
                    on the flank look sufficiently to the left and right. You‟re aiming for close to 180°
                    coverage, rather than 90°.
                </p>
                <h3>Vehicle Tactics</h3>
                <p>
                    In scenarios involving vehicles, fireteam leads must manage vehicle entry and exit, 
                    spacing, and cover for mobile operations.
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Entering Vehicles:</strong> Enter last to confirm team members are on board.</li>
                        <li><strong>Vehicle Spacing:</strong> Maintain 25-50 meters between vehicles to avoid multiple casualties from explosives.</li>
                        <li><strong>Screening Vehicles:</strong> Position infantry to cover vehicles from close-range threats.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <h3>ERP - Emergency Rendezvous Point</h3>
                <p>
                    ERPs are defined by squad leaders as part of an overall plan. They are places to
                    retreat to and regroup with the rest of your squad. Your squad leader might give
                    you the command to retreat to an ERP, or you might retreat there of your own
                    accord if you lose radio communications with the squad.
                </p>
                <h3>OP - Observation Point</h3>
                <p>
                    OPs are defined by the squad leader as part of an overall plan. They are
                    generally safer positions from where the squad can perform recon, like hilltops.
                    They are numbered in ascending fashion, starting at 1. Consider the positioning
                    of an OP marker as a guideline. Find the best position within ~50 metres, rather
                    than stopping right on the marker.
                </p>
                <h3>AP - Attacking Point</h3>
                <p>
                    Aps are defined by squad leaders as part of an overall plan. They are more
                    dangerous positions from where fireteams engage hostile forces, generally with
                    some form of cover nearby. They are numbered in ascending fashion, starting at
                    1. Consider the positioning of an AP marker as a guideline. Find the best position
                    within ~50 metres, rather than stopping right on the marker.
                </p>
                <h3>Overwatch</h3>
                <p>
                    Overwatch is a simplified version of the fireteam tactic „bounding overwatch‟.
                    Only one of the two elements will move, while the other sets up in a position that
                    has adequate cover and line of sight towards potential threats. Generally these
                    positions will be hills, treelines, or buildings. Overwatch can be executed both
                    with and without suppressive fire.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The covering element should ideally have weaponry that can be used over long
                    distances, like machine guns and marksman/sniper rifles. This tactic is useful for
                    crossing large open distances when having access to aforementioned weaponry,
                    which makes it ideal at a squad level with support elements (humvees, MMG
                    teams, etc.).
                </p>
                <h3>Flanking</h3>
                <p>
                    Flanking can be a very efficient tactic for a fireteam to utilize, because of its
                    ability to effectively neutralize the cover an enemy might have, while also
                    catching them by surprise. It requires proper setup and good reading of the
                    terrain, because a flanking move can leave your own fireteam in a vulnerable
                    position instead. On a squad level, flanking moves can happen in two ways. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The first option would be during a close range firefight (e.g. after a „contact‟
                    procedure), where squad lead will ask one or more teams to flank in a certain
                    cardinal direction while the other teams hold their position to distract the enemy.
                    This will prompt the fireteam leader to first break contact with the enemy and
                    move in the direction squad lead has asked of them. The idea is to stay out sight
                    of the enemy, until you‟ve achieved close to a 90° angle to the direction your
                    enemy is facing, at which point your fireteam will pop up and engage them. To
                    achieve this you‟ll need to move 50-100 metres in the direction squad lead has
                    asked you to flank, making use of the available terrain to hide yourself from view
                    and finding a position with cover if possible.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Squad leaders will call for this form of flanking in the following way: 
                    “*<strong>TEAMS TO FLANK</strong>*, flank *<strong>DIRECTION</strong>”
                </p>
                <p>
                    The second option is much simpler, where squad lead will mark a position on
                    your map (usually an „Attacking Point‟) which will hopefully put you in a flanking
                    position. The principles of staying out of view while flanking and finding a
                    position with cover when opening fire remain the same here.
                    <ul>The keys to a good flank are as follow:
                        <li>
                            The base of fire should be sizeable enough that it can hold off the enemy
                            long enough for the flank to be executed.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The flank should happen quickly, so that the base of fire doesn‟t get overrun.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The flank shouldn‟t be spotted before it can be executed, as it gives the
                            enemy time to find cover against it.    
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The enemy positions shouldn‟t have easily accessible cover that can be
                            taken up against the flanking position.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    If you happen to be part of the base of fire in a flanking manoeuvre, take note of
                    where friendly forces are flanking to, so that you don‟t engage them by accident.
                </p>
                <h3>Suppressive fire</h3>
                <p>
                    As mentioned in Basic Infantry, suppressive fire is used extensively in our
                    tactics, as the mods we use make it effective against the AI. It will make them
                    seek cover and cease fire themselves, which improves your chances of survival.
                    However, it‟s important to get suppressive fire as close as possible to the
                    enemies for maximum effect. Try to pinpoint where the enemy is shooting from
                    and return fire in that direction.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Your fireteam members will often be reluctant to fire if they don‟t see enemies,
                    which means you will have to make them. Call out: 
                    “<strong>Suppressive fire to the *DIRECTION/LANDMARK</strong>*”. 
                    Additionally calling out things like 
                    “<strong>Start shooting!</strong>” can often be enough to get them firing off rounds.
                    A rule of thumb is to have every man with a rifle fire off one round per second. 
                    For machine guns, this ends up being one three-round burst per second.
                </p>
                <h3>Injuries and medical emergencies</h3>
                <p>
                    In any given mission, it‟s quite likely one or more of your fireteam members will
                    get shot, which means you‟ll need to know how to deal with that. The first step is
                    to find out they‟ve been shot. Checking regularly during a firefight if anyone is
                    wounded by asking: “<strong>Is anyone wounded?</strong>”, by checking your shacktac hud
                    and by looking at your team members directly is crucial to sniffing out injuries
                    and dealing with them.
                </p>
                <p>We can differentiate injuries into three categories:
                   <ul>

                            <strong>Critical injuries</strong> are those where your team member‟s life is in grave danger
                            within the coming minutes. Good indicators are multiple large, heavily bleeding
                            wounds and loss of consciousness. Your first priority should be to bring the
                            injured member to a safe position, usually behind hard cover. You might have to
                            drag or carry the person to this location. Then, you should stabilize him as best
                            as possible by making use of bandages and tourniquets as needed. At this point
                            you should assess if you are capable of stabilizing the patient without the help of
                            a medic. If the answer is no, you should immediately contact your squad leader,
                            letting him know you urgently need a medic and that the wounded member is in
                            a safe location, and where that location is (usually “at my location” is sufficient).
                            If you are capable of stabilizing him yourself, do so and refer to the „non-critical
                            injuries section‟ on what to do next.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Non-critical injuries</strong> are those where your team member‟s life is not in grave
                            danger in the coming minutes. They might have taken one or a couple of small
                            or average wounds and are not unconscious for an extended duration of time.
                            Order the relevant team member to find cover and bandage/tourniquet
                            themselves as quickly as possible. Use smoke if no cover is available. An
                            exception to this is something like bounding overwatch or other situations where
                            fast movement is critical. If the injury is light enough and not movement
                            impairing, they should ignore it and keep moving. Make sure to deal with the
                            injury appropriately when the situation makes this possible. You should inform
                            your squad leader when team members sustain non-critical injuries, however you
                            should not call for a medic until the firefight has died down or the manoeuvre has
                            ended at which point your injured team member(s) can move to a safe location
                            indicated by squad lead, where they will be treated. The medic should never
                            have to risk his life to heal non-critical injuries.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Movement impairing injuries</strong> are injuries to the legs that prevent a soldier
                            from moving faster than walking pace. They generally follow the same rules as
                            non-critical injuries (see above), but they are slightly higher priority, because
                            they will slow down the entire squad. In a situation where a team member has
                            sustain a movement impairing injury while moving fast is critical, have someone
                            else carry the injured team member to safety, while informing your squad leader
                            that one of your team members cannot run. Refer to non-critical injuries section
                            for further steps.

        <section class="manual-section" id="MOUT">
            <h2 onclick="toggleSection('MOUT-content')" class="collapsible">MOUT</h2>
            <div class="content" id="MOUT-content">
                <p>
                    We won‟t be discussing fireteam leading in urban terrain here in depth,
                    considering the MOUT training document covers that. The unique thing about
                    MOUT from a fireteam leader‟s perspective is that you won‟t always be up front.
                    This means every fireteam member is expected to know how and when to use all
                    MOUT procedures, however in reality not everyone will. Make sure to take charge
                    of your fireteam and tell the point man what to do if you notice he‟s hesitating.
                    There are, however, a couple of things you‟ll still be in charge of that are worth
                    discussing.
                </p>
                <h3>Speed of movement</h3>
                <p>
                    As you set of, define the speed of movement by declaring out loud whether it‟s a
                    slow move or a quick move. A slow move means the point man changes with
                    every procedure (see “MOUT SOPs”), whereas a quick move keeps you fully in
                    charge as point man.
                </p>
                <h3>Direction of movement</h3>
                <p>
                    Before the usual changes of point man in our MOUT procedures happen, your
                    team needs to know where to go. Use simple instructions like landmarks and
                    cardinal directions, don‟t resort to map markers.
                </p>
                <h3>Compound clearing</h3>
                <p>
                    As described in the MOUT SOPs, compound clearing generally starts with a 180°
                    slice, followed by each buddy team clearing half of the compound (left and right
                    respectively). Make you tell each buddy team whether they‟ll be going left or
                    right before entering.
                </p>
                <h3>Split column</h3>
                <p>
                    Your main priority here is to make sure your team stays level with the team on
                    the other side of the street. Either make your team slow down, or ask the other
                    team to slow down. Trying to get either team to speed up will only lead to more
                    mistakes.

            <div class="content" id="vehicle-tactics-content">
                <p>
                    As of writing no formal vehicle training guide has been written. However, as an
                    FTL there are some concepts you need to understand and apply in order to make
                    the most out of vehicles. They can be both a blessing by providing a lot of
                    firepower and a curse by limiting your maneuverability. This section will discuss
                    situations in which your fireteam controls a vehicle (Humvees, MRAPs, etc.) as
                    well as situations in which your team will work alongside a vehicle controlled by
                    another element (APCs, tanks, etc.).
                </p>
                <h3>Entering vehicles</h3>
                <p>
                    By default every fireteam member has a set position within your typical wheeled
                    vehicle. In unarmed vehicles the rifleman (AT) drives the vehicle, while the
                    fireteam leader sits in the front passenger seat. If the vehicle is armed, the
                    assistant automatic rifleman (AAR) will man the gun. The logic behind this setup
                    is that you have the junior member drive the vehicle with the fireteam leader up
                    front with a clear view of the road to navigate. The assistant automatic rifleman
                    gets to man the gun, so that your automatic rifleman (AR) is free to use his LMG,
                    maximizing your firepower. You can override this setup if you like, but make sure
                    you have a good reason for doing so.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finally, make sure to always enter your vehicle last, so that you can verify your
                    team members are inside. This is especially important when you enter a vehicle
                    you don‟t control. In this case make sure to call out “*YOUR CALLSIGN*, all
                    in.</strong>”, so that the crew and squad lead know that your fireteam is in. Some
                    vehicles, particularly APCs and helicopters, require you to do this over the radio.
                    There is no need to establish communications first in this case.
                </p>
                <h3>Exiting vehicles</h3>
                <p>
                    There are two ways to exit a vehicle. Either everyone gets out, or the driver (and
                    gunner) stay in. So make sure to either call: “<strong>Everybody out/everybody
                    dismount</strong>” or “<strong>Dismount, driver and gunner stay in</strong>”, so that your team
                    knows who is leaving the vehicle.
                </p>
                <h3>Speed of movement</h3>
                <p>
                    Vehicles have three speeds: slow, normal, and fast. Make sure you know what
                    speed you‟re supposed to be using and tell the driver which speed you want him
                    to maintain.
                </p>
                <h3>Navigating</h3>
                <p>
                    Navigating is something you‟ll be doing a lot in vehicles, primarily if your vehicle
                    is on point in a convoy or when your vehicle is driving off on its own. Before
                    setting off, have a look at the waypoints squad lead has set up and understand
                    where you‟re supposed to stop and/or dismount. Try to visualize how you‟re
                    going to drive the route and where the turns are.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Generally the biggest challenges will be getting your vehicle onto a road and the
                    turns you‟ll have to make on or off those roads. Alternate between having the
                    map open and looking through the windshield to determine where you are and
                    when to give instructions for a turn. You‟ll want to give instructions well in
                    advance, at least 100 metres before a turn, repeating those same instructions
                    when your vehicle arrives at the turn. Highlight possible landmarks and explain
                    where the driver is supposed to go next, either in the form of turning left/right,
                    or by using cardinal directions. In the case of going off road, it can help to use
                    “on my mark” when explain the instructions and calling out “mark” when the
                    turning position is reached. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    A couple of examples:<br><br>
                    Example 1:<br>
                    <strong>“T-intersection coming up in 200 metres where we’ll turn right.”</strong><br>
                    <strong>“Turn right here”</strong><br>
                    Example 2:<br>
                    <strong>“On my mark we are turning straight north off road.”</strong><br>
                    <strong>“Mark, go straight north.”</strong><br>
                </p>
                <h3>Vehicle spacing</h3>
                <p>
                    Just like in infantry tactics, spacing is very important for convoys. We tend to
                    maintain 25 - 50 metres worth of spacing between each vehicle, both to avoid
                    explosives damaging multiple vehicles, and to prevent friendlies crashing into
                    each other.
                </p>
                <h3>Guiding vehicle fire</h3>
                <p>
                    See “Light machine guns and guiding fire” earlier in this document.
                </p>
                <h3>Screening a vehicle</h3>
                <p>
                    Screening a vehicle means putting friendly infantry units around a vehicle in
                    order to compensate for the slow turning speed of a vehicle‟s turret and its
                    limited field of view to keep it safe from close range attacks. This is primarily
                    done in forests and urban terrain. The goal is to have your team members close
                    enough that they can cover the vehicle, while also not getting hit when the
                    screened vehicle gets hit by explosives.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When screening your own vehicle, unload everyone but the driver and gunner.
                    You‟ll usually be in a squad when doing this, so position the friendly team
                    members in positions where the vehicle requires the most cover. If you‟re on
                    point, this means in front. If you‟re in the middle this means on the sides. If
                    you‟re in the back, this means in the rear. Put your people on either side of the
                    roads, 10-15 metres ahead or behind of the vehicle, or right next to them if
                    you‟re in the middle of a convoy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When screening another element‟s vehicle, form a rectangle around the vehicle
                    with all available elements. If it‟s just you, this means one fireteam member on
                    each corner. If there are two elements, then one element will cover the front and
                    another will cover the rear.
                </p>
