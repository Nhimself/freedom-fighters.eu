            <div class="content" id="role-content">
                <p><strong>Setting the Tone:</strong> <br> Before we get into the nitty gritty of being an FTL, we have to talk about setting
                    “the tone”. This can be defined as the general mood or atmosphere within the
                    session. For our tactics to work and for you to be an effective fireteam lead, the
                    tone has to be serious. We sometimes refer to it as “game faces”. Everyone
                    stops joking around and focuses on playing the game. As the leader of your
                    group, you are responsible for setting and maintaining the tone. If one of your
                    team members starts cracking jokes when it‟s inappropriate (e.g. you are about
                    to make contact with the enemy), you have to call them on it and get them to
                    focus. If you can‟t get them to shut up and take the game seriously, report it to
                    the admins. We don‟t tolerate players who don‟t respect their team lead.</p>
                <p><strong>Enforcing Tactics:</strong> <br>
                    Your team mates will often forget or choose not to properly execute a certain
                    tactic or procedure, which can put their or others‟ lives at risk. As a fireteam
                    lead, it is your job make sure they adhere to our standard of play. Make sure you
                    are fully up to date on all relevant trainings, because you are the role model for
                    the average player.</p>
                <p><strong>Autonomy:</strong> <br>
                    Styles of squad leading vary from person to person, but as a fireteam lead you
                    can expect a certain level of autonomy. Don‟t expect your squad leader to
                    micromanage you. He will tell you to clear a building or move to a certain
                    position and it‟s up to you to figure out the best way to do it. This doesn‟t take
                    away the fact that you can still call up your squad leader if you don‟t know how
                    to best carry out their orders.</p>
                <p><strong>Keep it Fun:</strong> <br> 
                    At the end of the day we‟re all still playing a game. It‟s important that you keep
                    everyone focused and playing the game up to our standards, but it‟s equally
                    important that it‟s a fun experience for everyone. On one hand this means
                    playing a style of Arma that is more than just sitting on a hilltop plinking away at
                    enemies. We don‟t just use fire and manoeuvre tactics because they‟re effective,
                    but also because they‟re fun. Be dynamic, not static. On the other hand you
                    should balance out the aforementioned seriousness with some levity. Set the
                    example of when banter is appropriate. Tell jokes during a long car ride, or when
                    we‟re waiting on something or someone. You might make some friends along the
                    way.</p>

            <div class="content" id="equipment-content">
                <p>This section will describe the equipment you will have at your disposal as a
                    fireteam lead and how to use it to its maximum effect.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Binoculars</strong> <br> 
                        Every fireteam has two sets of binoculars. The fireteam lead and the assistant
                        automatic rifleman each have one. It is important to use them sparingly. You
                        don‟t want to spend an entire firefight with your binoculars out when you could
                        be laying down fire instead. Remember that you are one of four rifles in your
                        team. If you‟re within 300 metres, you should be firing instead of watching.</li>
                    <li><strong>Smoke Grenades</strong> <br> 
                        Smoke grenades are an extremely useful tool when used right. You have eight
                        smoke grenades spread out over your fireteam. Make sure to use them.
                        Their main purpose is to break line of sight between you and your enemy. This
                        causes the enemy‟s fire to become less accurate or even stop, which allows you
                        to make an aggressive move, or fall back.
                        Smoke positioning is very important. The closer the smoke grenade lands to the
                        enemy, the more it will obscure their view, but the easier it will be for them to
                        reposition to see past the smoke. This principle also applies to your team, so it is
                        generally ill-advised to throw a smoke grenade right on top of yourself. Throw it
                        in the enemies‟ direction instead.
                        Wind direction and strength will heavily influence how useful your smoke is.
                        Stronger winds will mean a longer, lower smoke screen. Always take note of the
                        wind direction to position your smokes appropriately.
                        If you ever need an emergency smoke screen, call out: “TEAM NAME, pop smoke
                        to the DIRECTION OF ENEMY FIRE”.</li>
                    <li><strong>Grenade Launcher</strong> <br> 
                        The under barrel grenade launcher can be a very useful weapon when used
                        appropriately. You have two types of grenades to fire.5
                        First, you have HE (high explosive) grenades. These are useful for indirect fire to
                        hit targets you can‟t see, killing groups of enemies, destroying or damaging
                        vehicles, etc. Because of their destructive nature, you have to be very careful
                        when using them. Make sure there are no friendly or civilian units close to your
                        target.
                        Second, you have smoke grenades (white, red, green). These can be useful to to
                        create smoke cover at long range and mark enemy (red) or friendly (green)
                        positions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Anti-Tank Weapons</strong> <br>
                        Every fireteam has an unguided anti-tank launcher with one rocket. Its effective
                        range is about 300-400 metres depending on the launcher itself. Its primary use
                        is to destroy vehicles (particularly armoured vehicles), but it can also be used to
                        destroy buildings or blow holes in walls (breaching) to create alternative entry
                        points.
                        If you hear or see a vehicle approaching that‟s worthy of being blown up with
                        your AT launcher, call out: “Ready AT”. Don‟t leave your rifleman in this state too
                        long, though. He won‟t be able to fire his rifle and you risk him blowing up your
                        entire team if he‟s not careful. Always make sure the appropriate backblast
                        procedure is used to prevent accidental injuries.</li>
                    <li><strong>Light machine guns and guiding fire</strong><br>
                        The automatic rifleman (AR) is probably the most important member of your
                        team besides yourself. He puts down a large volume of fire and can do so at up
                        to 600 metres. It is very important to always put your AR in the best position to
                        engage enemies in order to get maximum value out of his machine gun.
                        At longer ranges, it is important to guide the fire of your machine gunner. This is
                        where your binoculars become very useful, because you yourself cannot
                        effectively engage enemies beyond 300 metres. Watch for the tracers and the
                        impacts of your AR‟s fire and correct appropriately using UP, DOWN, LEFT, or
                        RIGHT followed by the number of metres that your AR should adjust for in order
                        to hit the target. For example, if your machine gunner‟s fire is landing five
                        metres below and two metres left of the target, you would say: “up five, right
                        two”.</li>

        <!-- Section: Communication -->
        <section class="manual-section" id="communication">
            <h2 onclick="toggleSection('communication-content')" class="collapsible">Communication</h2>
            <div class="content" id="communication-content">
                <p>Communication within a squad is very important. It provides situational
                    awareness for everyone involved which leads to better decision making. Know
                    where all friendly elements are and what they are doing. You‟re not just limited
                    to communication with your squad leader. You can and should coordinate with
                    other fireteams when necessary.
                    Furthermore, the fireteam lead is the relay between your team members and
                    other leaders. Other members of the fireteam have no business on the radio,
                    unless you are dead. The communication from a fireteam should come from one
                    source only.
                    Finally, always keep your squad lead up to date on what you‟re doing. This
                    doesn‟t mean you should be radioing in every five seconds, but if you‟re starting
                    an attack or you have completed an order, let squad lead know.</p>

        <section class="manual-section" id="infantry-tactics">
            <h2 onclick="toggleSection('infantry-tactics-content')" class="collapsible">Infantry Tactics</h2>
            <div class="content" id="infantry-tactics-content">
                <p>This is the most important section of this training document. You will spend most
                    of your team on foot as a fireteam leader and as such you need to be able to
                    apply all concepts mentioned below. They will keep your team alive.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>General Orders:</strong>
                        <p>
                        There are the orders you will be using pretty much every couple of minutes
                        360 coverage. <br>
                        “Watch your sectors” or “360” are the most common call-outs. The goal here is
                        to have every team member cover a 90° angle so that you are never caught out
                        by flanking enemies. Your team will forget and want to look forwards where the
                        enemies are. If you don‟t need them to shoot, make them watch their sectors.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>The general set-up (as mentioned in basic infantry) is</strong></li>
                            <li>Fireteam lead – front</li>
                            <li>Automatic rifleman – right</li>
                            <li>Assistant automatic rifleman – left</li>
                            <li>Rifleman (AT) – rear    </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                        You can modify this setup depending on where hostiles are most likely to come
                        from. For example, if you expect enemies from the left, you can put the AR there
                        instead.</p>
                        <p>
                        <strong>Move/hold</strong>
                        “Moving” or “Moving out”, and “Hold”, “Holding” are the most common call-outs.
                        Because your team mates are diligently watching their sectors, they can‟t always
                        tell when the team starts or stops moving. Therefore, you should always let your
                        team know when you‟re holding or moving.</p>
                        <strong>Cover</strong>
                        <p>“Grab cover”, “Grab a tree”, “Get in cover”, etc. are the most used call-outs.
                        You‟d be surprised how often people don‟t get in cover because they want to get
                        kills. Staying alive is usually more important than getting cover (with the
                        exception of the contact drill). Watch your team members and call them out
                        individually if you have to. You can save many lives if you consistently make
                        your team members seek cover.</p>
                        <strong>Spacing</strong>
                        <p>“Watch your spacing”, “Spread out”, etc. are the most used call-outs.
                        Again, this is easily forgotten by people, but it is very important. You avoid
                        getting everyone killed by a grenade, but you also avoid everyone getting
                        mowed down with one machine gun burst. Appropriate spread is 5-10 metres
                        between each team member.</p>
                        <strong>Weapons up/down</strong>
                        <p>“Weapons up” and “weapons down” are the appropriate call-outs.
                        Weapons down is used in situations where you don‟t expect contact, because it
                        consumes less stamina.
                        Weapons up is used when contact is likely.</p>
                        <strong>Formations</strong>
                        <p>These have been discussed in basic infantry, but we‟ll discuss them from a
                        fireteam lead‟s point of view here.</p>
                        The <strong>column</strong> is the most used formation, because it is dead simple to use.
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Purpose</strong></li>
                            <li>Travel in safe areas</li>
                            <li>Travel in difficult terrain</li>
                            <li>Appropriate speeds: walking - combat pace – jogging - sprinting</li>
                        </ul> 
                        <p>
                        The <strong>wedge</strong> is very useful, because it provides good firing lines in all directions,
                        but it is difficult to maneuver with.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Purpose</strong></li>
                            <li>When expecting contact, assaulting a position</li>
                            <li>Appropriate speeds: walking – combat pace – jogging</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                        The <strong>line</strong> is a very specific formation that should only be used in specific
                        situations. It has great firing capabilities towards the front, but poor 360
                        coverage.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Purpose</strong></li>

                        Forests are an exception. You can and should still order formations within
                        forests, but it is far more important that your team members move from tree to
                        tree. This will make them harder to hit and spot. An exception to this exception
                        is if you have to move quickly through the forest.</p>
                        <p>
                        While holding, you should apply the general principle that cover is more
                        important than a perfect formation. If a team member can move five to 10
                        metres in order to get behind a rock or a tree, make them</p>
                    <li><strong>Buddy Teams:</strong> <br>
                        <p>
                        As explained in basic infantry, the fireteam is further divided into two buddy
                        teams: Red (FTL + Rifleman) and Blue (AR + AAR). The reasoning behind this is
                        that you put the most and least experienced team member together and the AR
                        with the AAR. Always appoint a buddy team leader. He‟ll be in charge of
                        executing your orders and communicating with you. You want one clear voice to
                        communicate with, rather than two disjointed ones.</p>
                        <p>
                        Buddy teams are extremely useful for splitting up the team. You can quickly clear
                        two houses by splitting up, or have the two teams cover separate corners in a
                        MOUT situation. They really come into play when you start using bounding
                        overwatch.</p></li>
                    <li><strong>Bounding:</strong> <br>
                        <p>As explained in advanced infantry, bounding overwatch is a fire and manoeuvre
                        tactic in order to move while under fire. It can be used within a team (buddy
                        team bounding) or between teams (fireteam bounding). This section will discuss
                        buddy team bounding.</p>
                        <p>“Bounding overwatch, blue move north” or “Blue, bound north” are the most
                        common call-outs. When bounding with suppressive fire, make sure to keep your
                        bounds short (30 metres at most). Bounds that take too long will no longer be
                        covered by suppressive fire. You‟ve got 30 seconds at most, considering a rate of
                        fire of 1 round per second and a 30 round magazine. If your second buddy teams
                        makes bounds that are too long, call them out on it the next time you bound
                        past them. Avoid using the radio for “moving” and “set” calls, because an entire
                        squad relies on the same short range radio channel. To end bounding overwatch,
                        call out for your team to “regroup on me”.</p>
                        <p>When bounding without suppressive fire, the maximum distance increases (~50-
                        75 metres), because you‟re not bound by the 30-second rule. </p></li>
                    <li><strong>Squad Formations:</strong> <br>
                        <p>Fireteam bounding works mostly the same as buddy team bounding. The main
                        differences are as follows. Bounding occurs between fireteams, rather than
                        between buddy teams and bounding distances are increased from 25-30 metres,
                        to 50-60 metres (up to 100 metres if not under fire). In order to achieve this
                        increased distance, firing rate should be lowered and it becomes more important
                        to find cover in the environment. This is compensated by having double the
                        amount of rifles you‟d have in buddy team bounding. ”Set” and “moving” calls
                        should be done over the short range radio. Finally, if the squad leader decides to
                        bound all 3 fireteams together, two of the fireteams will be grouped together
                        (typically 1 and 2).</p>
                        <p>The primary advantage of fireteam bounding is the increased distance between
                        bounds. This means less team is wasted stopping and starting movement, which
                        means faster movement overall. If large distances need to be crossed with
                        bounding, fireteam bounding becomes more attractive. Other advantages are the
                        ability to provide 360° coverage while bounding, and having more opportunities
                        to take cover. Downsides are the need of a radio, and fireteam members
                        sometimes needing to reload due to not lowering their rate of fire.
                        Fireteam bounding is called out in the following way: <strong>“*TEAMS TO BOUND*</strong>,
                        fireteam bounding to <strong>*DESTINATION/DIRECTION*, *TEAM X*</strong> move.”
                        Example: “Alpha 1, 2, fireteam bounding to the northeast, 1 move”.
                        If all three teams are involved, the call for which team to move first will make
                        clear which teams will be grouped together. Example: “Alpha 1, 2, and 3,
                        fireteam bounding to the northeast, 1 move”. This means Alpha 2 and 3 are
                        grouped together.</p></li>

            <div class="content" id="squad-formations-content">
                <p>Much like fireteams, squads can be formed up in multiple formations. We use the
                same three formations.</p>
                <p>The <strong>column</strong> is the most used squad formation, because it is very easy to use.
                It‟s generally used to travel long distances. In a full squad, the default order of
                movement in a column is 1 – 2 – Lead – 3. This keeps the lead element
                sufficiently in the back, while still its rear sector is still covered by a third
                fireteam.</p>
                <p>The <strong>wedge</strong> is primarily useful when the squad expects contact soon. The three
                fireteams form a wedge as expected, but the lead element will be in the middle
                of the wedge, rather than on the flanks.</P>
                <p>The <strong>line</strong> can be used to initiate contact when enemies are unaware, or in order
                to clear large hilltops. The three fireteams again form a line as expected, but the
                lead element will be behind the line.</p>
                <p>Sector coverage has an extra added layer in squad formations. Each fireteam
                should focus extra on the same sector that a team member would focus on in the
                same fireteam formation. For example in a squad column, fireteam 2 would focus
                extra on the right flank. This manifests itself with the fireteam leader focusing his
                attention more on that sector.</p>

                <p>Clearing hilltops can very dangerous. The combination of short sightlines and
                lack of cover can prove deadly. In order to minimize the risk, the line formation
                is used. This forces the fireteam to move slowly, and causes all fireteam
                members to crest the hilltop at the same time. Make sure the fireteam members
                on the flank look sufficiently to the left and right. You‟re aiming for close to 180°
                coverage, rather than 90°.  </p>
